# 🚀 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on **segmenting customers** of a shopping mall based on their **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score** using the **K-Means Clustering algorithm**. The segmentation helps businesses understand their customers better and design targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on customer dataset.  
- Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
- Implemented **K-Means clustering** for customer segmentation.  
- Visualized customer groups using:
  - 📊 2D Scatter Plots  
  - 🌀 PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` → Data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` → Machine Learning (K-Means, PCA)
